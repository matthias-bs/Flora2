# flora2 Pump Drivers

See [Infineon BTS117](https://www.infineon.com/cms/en/product/power/smart-low-side-high-side-switches/low-side-switches/classic-hitfet-24v/bts117/) _N channel vertical power FET in Smart SIPMOSÂ® technology_ manual/datasheet.
Ensure matching power supply and pump voltages. Check that your power supply's current capability matches the pumps' current requirements -- the initial currents may exceed the nominal currents.

## Note:

The pump drivers are low-side switches -- connect pump's **plus**-wire to **positive connector of power supply** and pump's **minus**-wire to PCB terminal **P1** or **P2**, respectively.
