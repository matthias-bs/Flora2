**Note 1:**

The Solar Power Manager can supply up to 1A @5V. Please make sure that the controller (with sensors) and pump(s) do not exceed this limit.

**Note 2:**

For battery voltage measurement, an additional wire has to be soldered to the Solar Power Manager (net label *VBAT* in the schematic). A small resistor (e.g. 10 Ohms) in series to the U_bat output should be added to avoid high currents in case of a short circuit.
